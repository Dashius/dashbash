# Dash Bash

Just a little .bashrc file.

It will allow the user to perform several tasks automatically, such as open up facebook messenger, hack chat, amazon cloud player as well as
encrypt and decrypt files, query an API with jcurl and display it nicely, and more.

If you have questions on what you need to run some of the functions or aliases, read the comments in the bashrc file.

I've also put my nanorc in there so that syntax highlighting is enabled on nano for most popular languages.

I made this for myself so I could move my bashrc around across my computers, but if you stumble upon this and feel it could be useful you may use this so long as you adhere to the license. 

An installation script is provided. It must be run with any of the following parameters:

-i : interactive mode.
-b : Install only bashrc.
-n : Install only nanorc.
-a : Install all.

Example: ./install.sh -i

Note: Running with no params displays the options shown above.

Cheers.
